# AmEx-Defaulting-Prediction

This repository shows an experiment comparing a deep nerural network implementing a descending architecture and a unet styled convolutional neural network implementation.

The data this was studied on was the [AmEx-Defaulting-Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction). The comparison was done only on the basis of a normalized dataset, no data transformations were applied apart from quantifying dates using the ```datatime``` library.
